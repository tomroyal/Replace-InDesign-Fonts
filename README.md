# Replace-InDesign-Fonts

This is a script for Adobe InDesign (tested on CC 2015) that allows you to replace fonts according to a list, without needing to use Find Font.

Installation is as simple as placing the script into your User Scripts folder. Configure the script by editing the array called theFontReplacements.

This is an "at-your-own-risk" kind of thing, so, you know.
